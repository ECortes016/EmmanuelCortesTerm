                    <p>
                        Although I've never had a "real" job, I have had some experience working with my
                        dad-landscaping-on the weekends and sometimes during my school breaks. When I first started
                        working with my dad, I was around 13 years old. During the first couple times that I went to
                        work with him, he would wake me up, but as I got older he would make me wake up by myself which
                        is part of the reason why I wake up at around 6am. Other than working with my dad, I've never
                        worked for someone else. if I hadn't taken West-MEC then my parents would've forced me to get
                        one, but since I am my parents told me not to worry about it and to focus on school first.

                    <p>
                        Without the mandatory West-MEC Coding volunteer hours, I don't think I would've done much
                        volunteering in my community. The first time that I went to volunteer was at the 3TV 43rd
                        Annual 10k Marathon, working for the Keep Phoenix Beautiful nonprofit organization. I went with
                        two of my classmates starting at 6 in the morning and ending at 12 noon just picking up trash
                        from the people downtown and the runners. For the first ever
                        time of me volunteering, it was an interesting experience. The second time I volunteered was
                        also for the same organization. This time I had more tasks than just picking up trash which I
                        liked.
