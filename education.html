            <h2>Elementary School</h2>
            <h3>Moon Mountain Elementary</h3>
            <p>
                The first ever school I attended was Moon Mountain Elementary, starting my school years with
                Head Start. The first day of Head Start was quite a scary day for me at the time, mainly for the reason
                that it was the
                first time my mom wasn't with me during that time. During kindergarten I made some new friends which
                are still my friends even to this day. While at Moon Mountain I discovered the passion I had for art.
                My mom then bought me a set of colored pencils and a sketch book for me to draw in which I still have
                to this day. Overall elementary school was nothing too special for me.

            <h2>Middle School</h2>
            <h3>Mountain Sky Junior High</h3>
            <p>
                The middle school that I went to was Mountain Sky and I personally disliked it. Although class started
                at
                8am which was nice to have since previously for elementary, school started at 7am. It was the first
                time that I met other student from different schools which I made friends with. It was also the first
                time I had different class periods. During the two years at this school I had two different science
                teachers that were very different than the others. They really pushed me to do more than what I thought
                I could. Looking forward to science was really the only thing I looked forward to other than getting to
                see my friends.

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <h3>Thunderbird High School</h3>
            <p>
                At the time of me writing this I am still attending Thunderbird High School and am a Junior. My
                Freshman year was a pretty good year for me, luckily high school wasn't what many told me it would be
                like. I did make some new friends during my Freshman year which I still have to this day. My Sophomore
                year was still a pretty easy year for me, I didn't have any difficult classes other than Honors Spanish
                because writing was and still is difficult for me. All the other classes I had were pretty easy. Now
                that I am in my Junior year, it is going pretty well. Again none of my classes are challenging, but
                some do assign a bit too much work which I believe is unnecessary. Overall my high school experience so
                far is going great, I neither like or dislike it.
