intro 

Hello, my name is Emmanuel Cortes and at the time of me writing this, I am attending the West-MEC
                    Coding Program. I am also attending a highschool called Thunderbird Highschool, not to mention that
                    I am
                    Junior with one more year of highschool, then I'll be off to a College or University. I hope to
                    continue this path of career down my life.
